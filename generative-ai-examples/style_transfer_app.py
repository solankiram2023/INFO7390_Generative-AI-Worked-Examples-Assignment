        ### Key Differences
        
        The comparison above highlights how style transfer affects text characteristics:
        
        1. **Vocabulary**: The classic style typically uses more unique words and archaic terms
        2. **Sentence Structure**: Classic text tends to have longer, more complex sentences
        3. **Word Choice**: Modern text uses contemporary terminology while classic text uses formal, literary language
        4. **References**: Modern text often includes data points and research, while classic text uses metaphors and philosophical references
        
        These differences reflect the distinct linguistic patterns of different historical periods and writing styles.
